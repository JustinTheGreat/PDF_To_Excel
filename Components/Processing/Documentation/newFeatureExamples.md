# Feature Implementation Examples

This document provides concrete examples of how to request and implement new features for the PDF processing framework using AI assistance. These examples demonstrate the recommended approach for different types of feature additions.

## Example 1: Adding Form Field Recognition

### Request to AI

```
Feature Name: Form Field Recognition

Description: Add capability to identify and extract data from PDF form fields (input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons) with their associated labels.

Integration Points: 
- Should be implemented as a new module in Processing/Parsers/
- Should be callable from Processing/Core/extraction.py
- Should return data in a format compatible with existing parsed_result structure

Files Provided:
- pdf_processor.py
- Processing/__init__.py
- Processing/document.py
- Processing/Core/extraction.py
- Processing/Parsers/table.py (as reference for parser implementation)
- Components/GeneralInfo.py
- Components/pdf_extractor.py

Expected Input: PDF path and optional parameters for form field detection sensitivity

Expected Output: Dictionary mapping form field labels to their values, structured as:
{
  "field_label": {
    "type": "text|checkbox|radio|dropdown",
    "value": "extracted value",
    "coordinates": {x0, y0, x1, y1}
  }
}

Business Rules:
- Form fields should be associated with their closest text label
- Checkbox values should be boolean (true/false)
- Radio button groups should be identified by common names

Additional Context:
- This will be used primarily for processing standardized forms like applications and intake documents
```

### Implementation Steps

The AI would then:

1. Create a new file `Processing/Parsers/forms.py` with the form field detection logic
2. Add integration points in `Processing/Core/extraction.py`
3. Add new extraction parameter options to support form field extraction
4. Document usage examples

## Example 2: Adding CSV Export Capability

### Request to AI

```
Feature Name: CSV Export

Description: Add functionality to export extracted PDF data to CSV format with configurable column mappings.

Integration Points:
- Should be implemented as a new module in Processing/
- Should be accessible as a function in the main pdf_processor.py
- Should be usable after JSON has been generated

Files Provided:
- pdf_processor.py
- Processing/__init__.py
- Processing/document.py
- Processing/Utilities/cleaner.py

Expected Input: 
- Path to JSON file or extracted data dictionary
- Column mapping configuration
- Output path for CSV file

Expected Output:
- Generated CSV file
- Return value should be the path to the created CSV

Business Rules:
- Headers should be configurable
- Should handle nested JSON structures by flattening with dot notation
- Should include options for filtering which fields to include

Additional Context:
- This will be used for data integration with legacy systems that require CSV imports
```

### Implementation Steps

The AI would then:

1. Create a new file `Processing/export.py` with CSV export functionality
2. Add a new function to `pdf_processor.py` that calls this functionality
3. Document the column mapping configuration format
4. Implement flattening logic for nested structures

## Example 3: Adding PDF Table of Contents Generation

### Request to AI

```
Feature Name: Table of Contents Generator

Description: Create a module that can analyze a PDF and generate a table of contents based on text formatting (size, style) and positional analysis.

Integration Points:
- Should be implemented as a standalone utility in Processing/Utilities/
- Should be callable from pdf_processor.py
- Should generate a structured TOC that can be added to the JSON output

Files Provided:
- pdf_processor.py
- Processing/__init__.py
- Processing/document.py
- Processing/Utilities/text.py
- Components/GeneralInfo.py

Expected Input:
- PDF path
- Configuration for heading detection (min font size, styles to consider, etc.)

Expected Output:
- Hierarchical structure of document headings with page numbers:
[
  {
    "level": 1,
    "text": "Chapter 1",
    "page": 5,
    "children": [
      {"level": 2, "text": "Section 1.1", "page": 6}
    ]
  }
]

Business Rules:
- Should detect heading hierarchy based on font size and formatting
- Should exclude header/footer text from TOC entries
- Should handle documents without explicit heading styles

Additional Context:
- This will be used for making large technical documents more navigable
```

### Implementation Steps

The AI would then:

1. Create a new file `Processing/Utilities/toc.py` with TOC generation logic
2. Implement font and style detection using pdfplumber capabilities
3. Add hierarchical organizing logic to create the TOC tree structure
4. Add integration with the main workflow

## Example 4: Adding PDF Split by Section Feature

### Request to AI

```
Feature Name: PDF Splitter

Description: Create functionality to split a PDF into multiple files based on detected sections, headings, or keywords.

Integration Points:
- Should be implemented as a new module in Processing/
- Should be callable independently from the main extraction process
- Should use existing text extraction capabilities

Files Provided:
- pdf_processor.py
- Processing/__init__.py
- Processing/Core/extraction.py
- Processing/Utilities/text.py
- Components/GeneralInfo.py

Expected Input:
- PDF path
- Split configuration (by heading, by keyword, by page count)
- Output directory

Expected Output:
- Multiple PDF files saved to the output directory
- JSON metadata about the split files (name, pages, split reason)

Business Rules:
- Should maintain original PDF quality
- Should handle bookmarks and internal links appropriately
- Should provide naming options for output files

Additional Context:
- This will be used for breaking down large reports into manageable sections for distribution
```

### Implementation Steps

The AI would then:

1. Create a new file `Processing/splitter.py` with PDF splitting functionality
2. Research and implement PDF manipulation using PyPDF2 or a similar library
3. Implement detection logic for different splitting strategies
4. Add output file naming and metadata generation

By using these examples as templates, you can effectively communicate your requirements to an AI assistant and receive well-structured implementations that integrate properly with your existing codebase.
